🗳️ Decentralized Voting System with Facial Authentication

A secure, tamper-proof blockchain-based voting platform that authenticates voters using live facial recognition and permanently records votes on the Ethereum blockchain.

This system is designed to ensure fair, transparent, and decentralized elections with strong identity verification.

✅ Key Guarantees

✔ One person = one vote
✔ Live camera authentication (no image upload allowed)
✔ Immutable vote storage on blockchain
✔ Secure admin panel with face-based login
✔ Fully decentralized and transparent vote counting

⚙ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Requirements

Python 3.10 recommended

Create a venv 

python -m venv venv310

then activate venv310

.\venv310\scripts\activate 

then 

pip install -r requirements.txt


⚠️ dlib is platform-dependent.
Install separately if required (Windows wheel / Linux build).

2️⃣ Configure MySQL
CREATE DATABASE decentralised_voting;


Update credentials in:

backend/models.py
backend/config/secret.py

3️⃣ Configure Blockchain (Important)

Edit backend/config/secret.py:

RPC_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:7545"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourContractAddress"
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY = "your-private-key"
ADMIN_ACCOUNT = "0xAdminAccount"


Deploy managedelection.sol and paste the contract address.

4️⃣ Run Server
cd backend
python app.py


Server runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
